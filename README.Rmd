Welcome to my 2022 #30DayChartChallenge repo. Clicking on a plot will take you to the code I wrote to build it. Happy browsing, and if you like what you see, [get in touch](https://twitter.com/cararthompson)! 

This year, I don't have capacity to do a plot a day, so I'm doing my best to combine prompts and focus on story telling. Let's see how that goes! 

## Comparisons

### I - Part-to-whole, historical, slope
